## FOLDER CONTENTS:  
UNREADABLE - Contains style files which did not contain any color palettes and generated empty GPL files.

These QGIS GPL files are being shared as-is for those who wish to have more symbology or more ESRI-like symbology in QGIS. Download and use them as you wish, but I make no guarantee of any kind on your use of the files.
